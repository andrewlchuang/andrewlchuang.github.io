                    <p class="prompt">"How might we design dashboards that enable students and instructors to give effective feedback for in-class presentations?"</p>
                    <p class="background-info">In a classroom, everyone is there to learn and get feedback. Students want to learn more about game design, for example, and receive suggestions on how to improve their skills. Instructors want to know how well they are relaying the content such that they can achieve students' learning goals. However, there are roadblocks that prevent students and insturctors from getting the feedback needed, especially during presentations: students are easily distracted, instructors how well students have grasped the information.</p>
                    <p class="background-info">To enable streamlined viewing and giving of feedback during a presentation, I created dashboards with two modes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="scrip"><b>Student Mode</b>: Dashboard in students can provide real-time feedback to presenters and upvote other individuals‚Äô comments</li>
                        <li class="scrip"><b>Instructor Mode</b>: Provide real-time feedback during presentation and monitor comments from rest of students</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="more-info">This project was done for the Interaction Design Overview Course (05-392) at Carnegie Mellon. <mark>To skip directly to the final deliverable, please click <b><a href="#final">here</a></b>.</mark></p>

                <p class="scrip">Though only two dashboards were needed at the end, the dashboard was created around the needs of three types of users: student listeners, student presenters, and insturctors. Since each group has their own needs, I started off by creating an empathy map of the three groups. In this map, I included group feelings, actions, goals, pain points, and influences.</p>

                    <li class="scrip">My dashboards placed a heavy emphasis on simplicity which is good, since it eliminates distractions, but also lacks core functionalities and might cause listeners to fall asleep and not be engaged.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="scrip">Knowing that I should work on these points, the main concern at the moment was balancing functionality and aesthetic. This will be a topic my black and white dashboard will aim to address. </p>

                <p class="scrip" style="margin-top: 20px;">This time, my design had a really clear point of entry. The contrast between the black sidebar and the white background allowed for both sections to be emphasized. The gray text box welcomed users to add in their own thoughts, opinions on the presentation as a whole. The black sidebar encouraged users to add category-specific feedback to those sections, as well as answers to the presenters questions. The design had core functionalities and allowed listeners to give feedback and listen to what the presenters are saying.</p>
                <p class="scrip">In addition, I shifted the focus of the dashboard from it being presentation-focused to topic-focused. Having additional pages where users can either give topic-specific feedback or help answer greatly improves the functionality of the dashboard, as listeners are motivated to give targeted feedback to the presenters.</p>

                    <li class="scrip">The incorporation of analytics and gauge to see which students were active/inactive is really beneficial for the instructor. This included graphs, statistics, percentages.</li>

            <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="scrip">In terms of color, I decided to go with lighter, duller, shades of blue  since it emphasizes text without becoming too distracting and powerful. I chose shades of light blue for instructor-endorsed comments since it popped out out of the shades of white and black, allowing it to be emphasized just the right amount. Darker shades went well with text embellishments, as it paired well with the black text and white background.</p>
            <p class="scrip">In terms of the black side bar, I added two features: livestream of comments and questions to consider. Comments from all students will appear on this bar, and students can search through them using the search bar or, they can swipe right to like the comments. The questions are also on the side bar so students can think about the questions throughout the presentation, and answer them as the presentation progresses. </p>

            <p class="scrip">Inspired by the insights incorporating analytics can bring, I decided to incorporate some here as well. On the black side bar, I added users that have not yet engaged as much. This gives the instructor a chance to check in with those that may be distracted, not engaged, or lost. The second section I added was the common keywords: it allows the instructor to peruse through topics that students are frequently mentioning in their responses. The size of the word correlates to how frequently the word was mentioned.</p>
            <p class="scrip">In terms of the content in the white box, it is split evenly between seeing what comments should be endorsed and a place where general feedback can be given. I figured that as an instructor, they do both conversation moderation and feedback-giving as well, explaining the need to split the section evenly.</p>
            <p class="scrip">These designs allowed for most core functionalities to exist in one spot while keeping the dashboard simple and usable, which is an improvement from the last one which had many tabs and features.</p>

            <p class="scrip">At this stage of the process, I received the following tips to improve the aesthetics and functionality of the dashboards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="scrip">The placement of the black side bar was not consistent and did not make sense. The viewer‚Äôs attention is first directed to the white box on one version and in another version, it is directed to the black box first. </li>
                <li class="scrip">Adding category tabs to each comment will allow grouping of comments to happen more easily/accessibly</li>
                <li class="scrip">A lot of the text is too thin, not readable</li>

                <p class="scrip">Moving forwards, I would love to incorporate data visualizations and graphics that display student activity throughout duration of presentation and the robustness of comments in the instructor view of the dashboards.</p>
                <p class="scrip">Throughout the process, I learned how colors contrasts and grid layouts can direct the focus of users. Though it took me a while to understand how to leverage these these tools, using them effectively can establish clear points of entry and continuous flow throughout the dashboard, allowing their needs to be met in an efficient and easy manner.</p>
