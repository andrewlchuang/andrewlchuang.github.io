                <p class="prompt">"How might we increase the personal connections between viewers and the arts?"</p>
                <p class="background-info">Public art, though abundant in large cities, feels indifferent to most passerbys. Many public arts fail to invoke viewers‚Äô feelings and are unsuccessful in establishing personal connections. So our team, consisting of <b>Chenning Ye</b>, <b>Jenny Liu</b>, <b>Jessica Xiao</b>, and <b>I</b>, chose to investigate how to increase these connections such that public arts can improve the quality of life for residents and visitors in the region. Through interviews and contextual methods, our research implied that deeper connections with public arts can establish a sense of belonging in a city. Forming deeper connections consists of a four step process: <b>attraction</b>, <b>information</b>, <b>conversation</b>, and <b>recollection</b> (<i>as seen in the visual above</i>).</p>

                <p class="role-description">In this project, I was a <b>User Researcher</b> and worked alongside my teammates each step of the way, leveraging research methodologies to generate relevant insights and prototype ideas. Methodologies we used include the following: contextual interviews, affinity diagramming, think-alouds for generative research, storyboarding, and speed dating. In addition, I was also an <b>Analyst</b> in which I streamlined data collection methods and analyzed collected data. In compliance with social distancing + stay at home measures during Spring 2020, all methods, with the exception of the reverse assumptions and wall walk (since it happened before campus was shut down), were conducted through online means.</p>

                <h3 class="methods">Defining the Problem Space</h3>
                <p class="methods">Given that the realm of public art is rather expansive, we first did a reverse assumptions activity (<i>bottom left image</i>): listing out our assumptions on public art and how people interact with them, writing the reverse assumptions about it, and what actions should be taken to achieve the situtation mentioned in the reverse assumption. This enabled my team and I to see the space from a different perspective as it encouraged us not to be fixated on a certain point of view.</p>
                <p class="methods">We then conducted a wall walk (<i>as seen in the bottom right image</i>) in which we merged our own quantitative data analyses, physical/online observations to gain a deeper understanding of the realm of public art. We sought to understand common themes between our initial observations and identify areas that need improvement, its importance labeled by a different colored sticky notes.</p>
                <p class="methods">Understanding that inclusion and connection were common thematic concerns, we decided to shape our main, overarching question along those topics:</p>

                <h3 class="methods">Contextual Interview and Synthesis</h3>
                <p class="methods">To answer this question, we decided to understand how art viewers who post frequently on social media. We chose to narrow down our interviewee pool in that manner since they must‚Äôve experienced some variety of a connection with the art piece, enough so that they chose to post on social media about their interaction. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row analysis">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p class="methods">Each team member conducted a contextual interview; I decided to interview a Bay-Area based Researcher who frequently shares murals and art pieces on her blog. Throughout the interview, they delved deep into their interest with public art and why they viewed them. Showing me pictures <i>(as seen below, first image; identifiers of interviewee removed)</i> of the art they has posted, I understood why and what qualities of the piece compelled them to share it on their travel blog. </p>
                <p class="affinity-ucre">With over 120 notes written from our interpretation session, we synthesized evidence, observations, and questions spanning four interviews through an affinity diagram . The establishment of an hierarchy <i>(as seen below, bottom two images)</i> enabled us to transform notes spanning diverse perspectives into insights that encapsulated how users connect with art. </p>
                <p class="affinity-ucre">The most important takeaway from our affinity diagram was that <b>the experience of viewing art is cyclical</b>. The cycle begins before the actual visit to the art, starting with the civic decisions that are made regarding public art. These decisions determine how art influences a community. The second part of the cycle is the visit. Different people admire different qualities about the artwork. The impact of the art extends beyond the initial moment, contributing to the third part of the cycle: the viewer develops an emotional relationship with the art which can influence their memory of the moment. The last step of the cycle dictates that a viewer‚Äôs perspective of the art can continue to fluctuate, based on their conversations with friends/family members.</p>

                <p class="think-aloud-text">One theme we noticed when creating the affinity diagram was that users perceived art differently based on whether they knew the artist or not. To better understand the differences, we each ran think-aloud protocols on Instagram. We asked users reflect verbally on public art pieces from someone they follow and a public art Instagram of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/streetart_official/?hl=en">our team‚Äôs choosing</a>. After reflecting on both accounts, we asked users to compare and contrast the experiences that they had.  We each created usability finding templates/summaries on issues we‚Äôve uncovered during our interviews; the following diagram displays themes seen throughout our summaries ranked in order of importance/severity.</p>

                <h3 class="methods">Ideation and Speed Dating</h3>
                <p class="storyboards-text">From our previous stage, we learned that users perceive art differently based on how well they know the artist, art can incite change if it is able to be understood by the viewer, and lack of prior knowledge causes users to seek patterns in between each piece created. With that in mind and using Crazy 8‚Äôs to generate ideas, we came up with potential solutions that fell into these four user needs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="storyboards-text">Users have the need to learn about their identities and cultures through arts , hence be able to identify with the local culture.</li>
                    <li class="storyboards-text">Users needs to store a sense of nostalgia and memory of seeing an art piece.</li>
                    <li class="storyboards-text">Users feel the need to talk about art with people in their social circle.</li>
                    <li class="storyboards-text">Users need a sense of mystery to trigger their curiosities.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="storyboards-text">We were each tasked with creating storyboards for each user need. The storyboards I created for user need one are located below:</p>

                <h2 class="title">Next Steps + Takeaways</h2>
                <p class="takeaway-description">Our next steps of the project include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="takeaway-description"><b>Prioritizing steps of the process</b>: which steps --- attraction, information, conversation, or recollection --- should we first put our resources towards.</li>
                    <li class="takeaway-description"><b>Refining and receiving user feedback on design solutions mentioned</b>: For each step of the process, we proposed design solutions that enables individuals to interact more with the art, fostering deeper connections. However, the prototypes aren't high fidelity nor are they user tested.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="takeaway-description">Throughout the course of the project, I was not only able to learn so much about public art but was also given the chance to model and practice methodologies learned in class with feedback from peers and instructors. Each method enabled me to challenge any assumptions I had and to delve deeper into the problem space.</p>
                <p class="takeaway-description">In addition, this project taught me a lot about adaptability. Given the nature of the pandemic, all activities were shifted online. Expecting before the start on the project to engage in plenty of in-person work session, I learned how to collaborate through remote means with my amazing team. Snips of how we collaborated, as seen on the team Zoom meeting to the bottom left and Messenger calls to the bottom right, are some of the ways we've effectively communicated and worked together throughout the project.</p>
