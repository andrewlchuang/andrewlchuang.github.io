                    <p class="description">Spring 2020 | 2 Weeks </p>
                    <p class="background-info">Let's face it: college, for most individuals, is an expensive investment. For instance, tuition at Carnegie Mellon without financial aid is over $55,000. College tuition overall has increased over 25 percent in the past 10 years and student debt, just between 2018-2019, has increased over 6 percent (CNBC). Thus, the value of a college education must be evaluated before making such a life-changing decision.</p>
                    <p class="background-info">Return on investment (ROI) is often used to determine the value of a college education. In this exploratory data analysis project, <b>Catherine Du</b> and I wanted to take a deeper dive into what factors increases the ROI of a certain college education. Specifically, we wanted to answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="scrip" style="font-weight: bold;">Does a school‚Äôs ranking increase the value traditionally lower-paying majors?</li>
                        <li class="scrip" style="font-weight: bold;">Do majors in high demand get paid well regardless of institution?</li>
                        <li class="scrip" style="font-weight: bold;">What is the relationship between starting salary, debt, and location of a school?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="more-info">This project was done for the Practical Data Science course (67-364) at Carnegie Mellon. <mark>To skip directly to the final deliverable, please click <b><a href="#final">here</a></b>.</mark></p>

The diagram below shows how we cleaned/prepared the data using the Pandas library in Python. Note that though there are many ways to calculate ROI, we used debt to starting salary ratio as our metric since both debt and starting salary are numerical factors that influence the financial wellness of college graduates.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Analysis</h2>
                <p class="scrip">To place the numbers and results in context, here are some factors that explain the findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="scrip">It is commonly believed that selective colleges offer <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/private-colleges-_b_1974948">more connections and a stronger alumni network</a> compared with other institutions. However, even with that aside, that selective colleges are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/college-applicants-from-families-in-the-1-percent-have-a-big-edge.html">composed of more students from the top one percent than the bottom twenty</a>. Richer students tend to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/13/richer-students-have-higher-graduate-income-study-finds">have higher salaries </a>post-graduation, compared with other peers.</li>
                    <li class="scrip"><a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/11/college-major-myths">Shortage of STEM skills</a> leads to a higher demand for people that have these skills, thus higher starting salaries for those majoring in STEM.</li>
                    <li class="scrip">Many cities that have the highest salaries are concentrated on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-places-to-live-in-america-for-a-high-salary-2016-3">the Northeast and California</a>. However, these areas also have the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080916/top-10-most-expensive-cities-us.asp">highest cost of living</a> in the country.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="scrip">These numbers, or even the explanations above, don't paint the whole picture of the college landscape. Here are some considerations that need to made when building upon these results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="scrip">One major confounding variable was the way in which we calculated the debt-to-salary ratio. After making the corresponding groups on Pandas and given the way the dataset was structured, we took the average of the median salaries and debt amounts for each major. Thus, when calculating debt and salary in this manner, we made the assumption that there was an equal number of students in each major.</li>
                    <li class="scrip">Though value can be determined by looking at the numbers, such as looking at the average debt and salary post-grad, we also need to look at qualitative factors as well. Existence of the right communities, 'fit', campus climate, and overall college satisfaction are just some of these factors that creates value in a college experience.</li>
                    <li class="scrip">Though liberal arts degrees don't offer high-paying starting salaries when compared to STEM majors, studies show that individuals with a liberal arts background tend to have <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/11/college-major-myths">higher mid-career wage growth</a> compared with those with a STEM background. In sum, one should study in a field that they are fascinated and interested in, big-picture wise.</li> 
                </ul>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h2 class="title">Takeaways</h2>
                <p class="scrip">If given more time on this project, we would build upon our findings by doing the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="scrip">Find different ways to calculate ROI</li>
                    <li class="scrip">Determine the effects in-state vs out-of-state and income levels have on debt and salary</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="scrip">Overall, this project re-emphasized how important exploratory data analysis is since there are many insights that can be drawn just simply by grouping and visualizing the data. I was able to refine my skills in Pandas and Tableau throughout the course of the project and had many assumptions about the college landscape as a whole challenged throughout the process.</p>
